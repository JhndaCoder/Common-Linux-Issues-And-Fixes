# Solutions for Linux Installation problems #
---
## Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹ ## 

Linux distributions are amazing and working with one on a daily basis is a wonderfull experience but sometimes there are some problems that come along with them.

Most of them are due to some issues with drivers or some other issues with the distribution. Maybe you are using an Nvidia graphics card but your distribution is not able to use it effectively, or some of your input devices might not work, like the trackpad on your laptop, or some of your monitors might not work etc..

## Motivation ##

This particular repository is a collection of some of the problems I faced and i hope this might help you out.
Obviously most of these solutions are out there but some of them are very difficult to find so I decided to create this particular repository to anyone who might be facing these problems and might be interested in these solutions.
